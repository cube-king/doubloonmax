## DoubloonMaxx
A free and open-source doubloon-per-hour and completion estimation software
While not exactly the most complex, this project clearly and concisely demonstrates knowledge and understanding of Javascript, CSS, HTML, JQuery, and general coding processes.
I'd really appreciate a vote or two, as many of the contenders / competition for this project will be AI-Generated or low effort.
I've put a lot of work into this, and I hope you find it helpful. Enjoy!
